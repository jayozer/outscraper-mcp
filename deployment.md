- Creating GitHub releases
- Package verification

### Setting up GitHub Actions

1. **Enable trusted publishing on PyPI:**
   - Go to PyPI project settings
   - Add GitHub Actions as trusted publisher
   - Configure environment names: `pypi` and `testpypi`

2. **Create version tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Check GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify PyPI package
   - Test installation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures:**
- Check Python version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are specified
- Ensure `pyproject.toml` is valid

**PyPI Upload Issues:**
- Verify trusted publishing is configured
- Check package name availability
- Ensure version number is incremented

**Smithery Issues:**
